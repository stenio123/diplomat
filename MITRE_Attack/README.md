# MITRE ATT&CK controls for GCP
## Background
### How many threats in the mitre attack framework?
The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a comprehensive knowledge base and model for cyber adversary tactics and techniques. As of my knowledge cut off in 2021, the MITRE ATT&CK framework lists over 140 unique tactics and techniques used by cyber adversaries. These tactics are organized into the following categories:

Initial Access
Execution
Persistence
Privilege Escalation
Defense Evasion
Credential Access
Discovery
Lateral Movement
Collection
Command and Control
Exfiltration
Impact
It's worth noting that the MITRE ATT&CK framework is regularly updated with new tactics and techniques, so the number of threats may have increased since my training.

### Which of these tactics can apply to google cloud object storage?
The tactics that can apply to Google Cloud Object Storage depend on the specific use case and security measures in place. However, some common tactics that could potentially apply to a Google Cloud Object Storage environment include:

Discovery: Adversaries may use reconnaissance techniques to locate and identify object storage systems within a target environment. This can include scanning for publicly accessible storage buckets or using Google Cloud APIs to search for buckets associated with a target organization.

Collection: Adversaries may use object storage systems as a repository for data they have collected from a target environment. This can include storing stolen credentials, sensitive documents, or other sensitive information.

Exfiltration: Adversaries may use object storage systems as a way to exfiltrate data from a target environment. For example, they may transfer large amounts of data to a cloud storage bucket that is accessible from their command and control infrastructure.

Defense Evasion: Adversaries may use cloud object storage to evade detection by storing malicious files or artifacts in a place that is difficult for defenders to monitor or scan. They may also use encryption or other means to conceal the data stored in object storage.

Impact: Adversaries may use cloud object storage to cause harm to a target environment by storing and distributing malware or other malicious files.

It's important to note that the security of a Google Cloud Object Storage environment is dependent on proper configuration and management, as well as the implementation of security measures such as encryption, access controls, and monitoring.

### What are steps to protect google cloud storage from these attacks?
Here are some steps that can help protect Google Cloud Storage from these attacks:

Access controls: Implement proper access controls to limit who can access the Google Cloud Storage environment. This can include restricting access based on IP addresses, using multi-factor authentication, and implementing fine-grained access control policies.

Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access or theft. Google Cloud Storage supports encryption for both data at rest and in transit.

Monitoring: Implement monitoring and logging to detect and respond to suspicious activity in the Google Cloud Storage environment. This can include setting up alerts for unusual or unauthorized access, as well as regularly reviewing log data for signs of compromise.

Buckets configuration: Ensure that all Google Cloud Storage buckets are properly configured with the appropriate access controls and encryption settings. This includes setting up private access for buckets that contain sensitive data.

Access to APIs: Limit access to Google Cloud Storage APIs to only those users and applications that require it, and monitor usage to detect any suspicious activity.

Data backup and disaster recovery: Implement a data backup and disaster recovery plan to ensure that critical data can be recovered in the event of a security incident or data loss.

Regular security audits: Regularly conduct security audits to ensure that the Google Cloud Storage environment is properly configured and secure. This can include regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.

By implementing these security measures and keeping up to date with the latest threats, you can reduce the risk of attack and protect sensitive data stored in Google Cloud Storage.


### How can i automate these security measures?
There are several ways to automate the security measures for Google Cloud Storage:

Google Cloud APIs: Google Cloud provides APIs that can be used to automate many of the security measures discussed above. For example, you can use the Google Cloud Storage API to automate the creation of storage buckets with specific access controls and encryption settings. You can also use the Google Cloud Resource Manager API to automate the creation of security policies and access controls.

Google Cloud Tools: Google Cloud provides several tools that can help automate security measures for Google Cloud Storage. For example, you can use Google Cloud Deployment Manager to automate the creation of storage buckets with specific configurations, or use Google Cloud Security Command Center to automate security monitoring and threat detection.

Infrastructure as Code: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform or CloudFormation can be used to automate the creation and configuration of Google Cloud Storage resources. This allows you to codify your security policies and processes, making it easier to deploy and manage a secure Google Cloud Storage environment.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): CI/CD tools such as Jenkins or CircleCI can be used to automate the deployment and management of applications that use Google Cloud Storage. This allows you to automate the creation of storage buckets and configure security policies as part of your deployment process.

By automating these security measures, you can ensure *consistent* and *secure configurations* for your Google Cloud Storage environment, as well as reduce the risk of human error or misconfiguration.
